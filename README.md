# AI-Powered Website Development (AuraRest AI)

This repository contains the documentation and workflow for **Task 2** of the **Future Interns Internship**. The project focuses on building a fully functional, AI-driven website using no-code platforms and automation tools to enhance user experience and business efficiency.

All website copy, including the "About Us" and "Product Features" sections, was generated using AI to ensure a consistent, professional, and inspiring tone of voice.

### 3. Smart Support (Chatbot)

Integrated an AI FAQ assistant that uses natural language processing to answer visitor queries 24/7 without manual intervention.

### 4. Automated Workflows

Established a connection via Zapier where new form submissions automatically trigger email notifications, demonstrating a "hands-off" lead generation system.
